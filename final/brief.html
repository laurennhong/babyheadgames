            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p id="summary">For my final project I will be revising Studio 3: Game On! to function more smoothly and to be visually more enticing. </p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>I would like to revise three aspects of the design. Firstly, I would like to change and add movement to my animations. For this, I will change my still illustrations into gifs. This will require me to also change the javascript to switch between the .gif version of my illustrations to the .jpg versions. I also want to make the transitions between mouse interactions smoother. Fixing the sudden layout shifts during game time. Lastly, I want to edit the javascript so that there are more audio options. Currently, you can only turn on the audio in my game, however, I want to make it so you can turn it off as well. </p>
