            <h2>User Test Observations</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Watching the user interact with my game I noticed an initial reaction of joy and excitement. This reassured me on the the visual aesthetic of my game. The design is enticing to users and engages them to want to play.</li>
                <li>When initially playing the game I noticed that some users took the time to read the instructions on the home page and some immediately began playing. Depending on the users, the written instructions may be useless to the design. This indicated that I need to make the game easily playable without the need to read the rules. </li>
                <li>While users were playing, some were confused on what the game was asking them to do. The similarities in button designs and fonts makes no clear indicator on what to do in the game. After the game, the lack of a satisfying reward made the end of the game unclear. A solution to this would be a clear visual reward to offer the user.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Post Test Interview</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What could be done to improve readability?
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="userA">User A: "Maybe you can add something that shows the dice is changing. Also, I was kinda confused at first what to click or do so if the instructions were more clear."</li>
                    <li class="userB">User B: "I think it’s help if I knew what the end goal is and if there was something at the end that told me I finished the game." </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Do you feel the illustrations, color palette, and typography add to the aesthetic theme of the game?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="userA">User A: "Yes, most definitely, I loved the art style of the web page. Especially the design of the dice with the little skulls on them. I think it really suits the horror theme."</li>
                    <li class="userB">User B: "Yes, I like the illustrations of the twins. It’s what I wanted to look at most of the time. I also love to fonts you chose."</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Was playing the game easy?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="userA">User A:"Yea, it took me a minute to figure it out and the pauses kind of confused me, but it seems like a pretty simple game."</li>
                    <li class="userB">User B: "Yea, after reading the instructions I kind of had an idea of what the game is supposed to do. I think throughout the game it got a little confusing, but it’s pretty self-explanatory."</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>After my user testing I want to change three elements. One, I want to change the button design and the font sizing within the game to make the instructions clearer to the user. Two, I want to add a motion graphic to the end of the game to reward users and signify when the game is over. Thirdly, I want to change the wording in my instructions to make clear the story of my game and what it is we’re asking the users to do. </p>
