            <h2>What are Modals and Do They Work?</h2>

            <p>A modal - also known as an overlay or dialog window - is a web element that is placed on top of a parent page that restricts any actions on the main page. This element is meant to “grab the user`s attention” and can have many different purposes. They can ask for user inputs such as a login window or show additional information about the main page.

            <p>Modals are used in both desktop and mobile devices. On desktop, they have specific anatomy and Baskanderi explains key principles that improve the modal design. On mobile, modals are harder to use due to the size restriction of the screen. Modal designs on mobile must be simple for them to be accessible and effective. The article also mentioned Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) which helps web applications be more accessible.
            </p>
            <p>In Naema Baskanderi`s article, Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows, she explains how people have become conditioned to immediately exit out of modals because they have built a reputation of being annoying and unnecessary. This is because of the excessive use of pop-up ads and sales marketing. This begs the question of whether or not modals can actually work. What design methods and choices can we make to make modals more effective and less irritating to the users?

            <p>In Salim Ansari`s article, Best Practices for Form Design, he provides 20 principles to follow for better form usability and design. The 20 principles include…

            <p>Ansari gives a clear framework to create forms. The key points I took from this article are to first be concise and clear with your content and be consistent and mindful with your design. Forms should only ask for the most necessary information. Some easy tips to remember are to put the easiest information first such as name, contact information, etc., and to pay attention to the spacing and sizing of your design elements. Ansari recommends putting labels above the input boxes and providing a progress bar or visual to clearly communicate what you are asking and how many steps the form contains. </p>
            <p>A website form that I think has an effective design in the 5 Love Languages site. On this site, you can take a quiz that will determine your love language based on 5 different love languages established by Gary Chapman, Ph.D. = author and counselor. The form is very accessible, there is clear contrast and the design is simple and consistent. There is also a progress bar that shows you how long the quiz will be and how far you`ve gotten. This makes the quiz more enjoyable and easier to take.
